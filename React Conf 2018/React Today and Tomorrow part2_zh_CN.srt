00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,550
嗨。我的名字是 Dan。我在 React

2
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,759
Team 工作，这是我第一次参加 React

3
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:28,160
大会。 [掌声] 刚才 Sophie 讲述了这三个

4
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,740
问题，我想大多数的开发者在 React

5
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,280
开发过程中都会遇到这些问题。当然，

6
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,629
我们可以逐一来解决

7
00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:38,509
这些问题。我们可以尝试独立地去  one by one, so we could try to solve them

8
00:00:38,509 --> 00:00:41,840
解决这些问题。但是实际上解决其中一个问题

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,829
可能会使其他问题更加严重。

10
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:48,199
比如我们尝试去解决

11
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:51,079
“包装地狱”的问题，将更多的逻辑放到

12
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:53,780
组件里面，那么我们的

13
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,879
组件会变得更大，而且更难以

14
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:58,879
重构。另一个方面，如果

15
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,910
我们尝试将组件拆分为

16
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:06,019
更小的片段，方便重用，那么

17
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:07,550
我们的组件树的嵌套更多了，

18
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,139
而且又会以

19
00:01:09,139 --> 00:01:13,519
“包装地狱” 收场。最后，无论那种情况，

20
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:15,499
使用 class 都会让人产生

21
00:01:15,499 --> 00:01:18,230
困惑。所以我们认为造成这种情况是因为

22
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,910
这不是三个独立的

23
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,660
问题。我们认为，这是一个问题的

24
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:27,470
三个症状。问题在于

25
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,749
React 没有原生提供一个比 class 组件更

26
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:34,850
简单，更小型，更轻量级的方式来

27
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,670
添加 state 或 生命周期。

28
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:41,360
而且一旦你使用了 class

29
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,420
组件，你没有办法在不造成“包装地狱”的情况下,

30
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,190
进一步拆分它。事实上，

31
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,889
这并不是一个新问题。如果你

32
00:01:51,889 --> 00:01:54,530
已经使用了 React 几年，

33
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,050
你也许还记得在 React

34
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,329
刚出来的时候，事实上已经包含了一个解决  came out it actually included a solution

35
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:03,110
方案。嗯，这个解决方案就是 mixins。

36
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,499
Mixins 能够让你在 class 之间复用

37
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:08,060
方法，通过这种方法可以

38
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,610
减少嵌套。所以我们要在

39
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:16,790
React 里面重新添加 mixins 吗？ [对 ... 不...]

40
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:20,310
对了，不，不，我们不会添加 mixins。

41
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,040
啊，我的意思是之前使用

42
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,230
mixins 的代码并不是无法使用了。

43
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,600
但是我们不再推荐在 React 里使用 mixins。

44
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,880
如果你好奇我们这么做的原因，可以在 React Blog 里面

45
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,910
查看我们之前写的一篇文章，题目是

46
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,040
《 Mixins 是有害的》。

47
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,910
在文章中，根据我们的  Blog, where we explain that we think in

48
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,420
实验结果，我们发现 mixins 带来的问题

49
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,000
远比它解决的问题

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,790
多。因此，我们不推荐大家

51
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,870
使用 mixins。那么也许

52
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,310
我们解决不了这个问题了，

53
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,860
因为这是 React 组件模型固有的

54
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,780
问题。也许我们不得不

55
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:10,470
选择接受现实。 [笑声] 或者也许

56
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,510
有另外一种书写组件的

57
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,720
形式，可以避免

58
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,200
这些问题。这也就是今天

59
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,680
我将要分享的内容。但是在

60
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,840
开始分享我们在 React 的

61
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,960
改动和新特性之前，我想先讲讲

62
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,200
一年前我们建立的

63
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,290
RFC 流程，RFC 表示

64
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,840
request for comments，它意味着

65
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,880
无论是我们还是其他人

66
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,680
想要对 React 做出

67
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,620
大量变化或者添加新特性时,

68
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,830
都需要撰写一个提案，提案里面

69
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,260
需要包含动机的详情和

70
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,660
该提案如何工作的详细设计。

71
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,250
这正是我们要做的事情。

72
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,520
我们非常兴奋地宣布：我们已经

73
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,040
准备好了一个提案

74
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,520
来解决这三个问题。

75
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,420
重要的是，本提案没有

76
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,820
不兼容的变化，也没有弃用任何功能。

77
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,990
本提案是严格添加性的、可选择的

78
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:20,790
而且增加了一些新的 APIs 来
 
79
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,610
帮助我们解决这些问题。并且我们

80
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,709
希望听到你们对本提案的反馈，

81
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:28,620
这也是为什么我们在今天发表本提案

82
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,440
的原因。我们想过很多

83
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,510
发表本提案的方式，

84
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,370
也许我们可以写好提案后，

85
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,240
提出一个 RFC 然后放在那里。 但是既然

86
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,700
我们总是要召开 React 大会，我们决定

87
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,650
在本次大会上发表这个提案。那么，

88
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:49,710
接下来进入 Demo 环节。

89
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:59,479
[掌声]

90
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:06,929
我的屏幕已经投在了显示器上。对不起，

91
00:05:06,929 --> 00:05:19,670
有点技术故障。

92
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,280
呃，有谁会用这个投影仪，来

93
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:33,250
帮帮我。[笑声] 呃，我能复制我的桌面吗？

94
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:41,290
请。

95
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:46,970
(我能) 是啊。 [笑声]

96
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,370
好的，但是屏幕上没有显示，我

97
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,980
什么都看不到。 [笑声]

98
00:05:53,980 --> 00:06:08,390
这就是我现在的问题。 [掌声]

99
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:17,180
好的，灾难过去了。[笑声]

100
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:22,020
好的，嗯，让我来稍微调整下

101
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:27,960
文字大小。你们能看清吗？ [可以的。] 好的。

102
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:34,140
那么，我们来看，这里是一个普通的 React 组件，

103
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,840
这是一个 Row 组件，这里有一些

104
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,870
样式，然后渲染出一个

105
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,170
人名。我们想要做的是

106
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:47,340
让这个名字可编辑。那么我们平时在 React 里

107
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,560
通常是怎么做的呢？我们需要

108
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,200
在这里添加一个 input，需要将这些内容放到

109
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,630
class 里面返回，添加一些本地

110
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,400
state，让 state 来

111
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,740
驱动 input。这也是我

112
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,190
准备做的事情。这也是现今大家通常做的事情。

113
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,390
我要 export default class

114
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:12,720
Greeding extends React component。我也

115
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,910
只会在这里使用稳定的 javaScript

116
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:20,840
语法。接下来是 constructor props, super props。

117
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,670
在这里把 state 里的 name 初始化为

118
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:30,960
Mary。接下来我要

119
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,320
声明一个 render 函数，复制一下这段代码然后

120
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:41,950
粘贴到这里。

121
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,680
对不起。

122
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,040
好的。我希望这里不再

123
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,450
仅仅渲染 name，我希望这里可以渲染一个

124
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,400
input。我把这里替换为

125
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,320
一个 input，然后 input 的值设置为

126
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:00,450
this.state.name。 然后

127
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:03,160
在 input 输入发生变化时，调用

128
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,910
this.handleNameChange， 这是我的

129
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:10,570
change 回调函数。我把它

130
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,330
声明在这里，当名字发生变化时，

131
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,660
像我们通常做的那样调用 setState 方法。然后

132
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,900
将 name 设置为 e.target.value

133
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:26,440
对吧。如果我编辑 ... [页面上报了 TypeError 的错误] 好吧，所以我

134
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:33,070
应该去绑定 ... [笑声] 对不起，我需要在这里绑定

135
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,940
events 事件。 好的，现在这样

136
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,390
我们就可以编辑它了，运行正常。

137
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,450
这个 class 组件我们应该非常熟悉了。你如果

138
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,280
使用 React 开发可能会遇到很多类似的

139
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:52,060
代码。但让我们后退一步，如果

140
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,300
想要使用 state 时，能否不必须使用

141
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,420
class 组件？我不确定

142
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,800
它如何运行。但是我就准备

143
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,560
跟据我的已知来进行，我需要渲染一个

144
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,390
input。我在这里放入一个 input。

145
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,979
这个 input 的 value 的值为

146
00:09:08,979 --> 00:09:11,469
当前的 name 的值，所以我就传入

147
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:14,710
name 值。我不知道从哪里获取 name。

148
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:18,359
它不是从 props 里面来，嗯，

149
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:22,410
我就在这里声明，我不知道它的值，

150
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:26,200
之后我再填写这一块。呃，这里应该也有一个

151
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,790
change 回调函数，我在

152
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:33,089
这里声明 onChange 函数 handleNameChange。

153
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:38,229
我在这里添加一个函数来

154
00:09:38,229 --> 00:09:42,160
处理事件。在这里我想要通知 React

155
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,430
设置 name 值到某处，但又一次地，

156
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,200
我不确定在 functional 组件里如何实现

157
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,999
这个功能。因此我就直接调用

158
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:51,280
一个叫做 setName 的方法。

159
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:57,010
使用当前的 input 的值。我把它

160
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:06,570
声明在这里。

161
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,040
好吧，由于这两件事情

162
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,080
是密切相关的，对吧。其中一个是 state 里

163
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,630
name 变量的当前值，

164
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:17,440
而另一个是一个函数，

165
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,700
该函数让我们去设置 state 里的 name 变量。

166
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,930
由于这两件事情

167
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,820
非常相关，我将它们

168
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:29,950
合并到一起作为一对值。

169
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,390
我们从某处一同获取到

170
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:35,220
它们的值。所以问题是我从哪里获取到它们？

171
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:40,050
答案是从 React 本地状态里面获取。 那么我如何

172
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,370
在 function 组件里面获取到 React 到本地状态呢？

173
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:46,960
嗯，我直接使用 use state

174
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:53,940
会怎样。

175
00:10:53,940 --> 00:11:01,230
把初始到状态传给 useState 函数来指定它的初始值。

176
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:08,010
我们来看一下程序运行是否正常。是的，运行正常。

177
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:17,310
[掌声和欢呼声]

178
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,630
So let's, let's compare the two

179
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:25,120
approaches. So on the left we have a

180
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,700
familiar class component. This state has

181
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,180
to be an object. Uh, we bind some event

182
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,160
handlers so that we can access. This

183
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,099
inside the event handler for this dot setState.

184
00:11:36,099 --> 00:11:39,160
When we call setState it

185
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,020
actually doesn't just set the state that

186
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,620
merges, the state are the argument into

187
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,050
the state object. And then when we want

188
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,120
to access the state which is this dot

189
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,359
state dot something. So in the

190
00:11:52,359 --> 00:11:55,359
example on the right, we don't need to

191
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:57,940
access this dot state dot something.

192
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,339
Because the name state variable is

193
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:02,530
already available in the function. It's

194
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:05,440
just the variable. And similarly when we

195
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,540
need to set the state, we don't need to

196
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,320
access this dot something. Because the

197
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,450
function that let us set the name is

198
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:19,270
also available in the scope. So what is

199
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:25,560
useState exactly? UseState is a hook. A

200
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,200
hook is a function provided by React

201
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,670
that lets you hook into React features

202
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,999
from your function components. And

203
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:38,979
useState is the first hook that we're going

204
00:12:38,979 --> 00:12:40,870
to take a look at today, but there are a

205
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,089
few more. So we're going to see them

206
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:52,250
later.

207
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,630
All right, so let's go back to our

208
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:58,170
familiar class example. So let's say we

209
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:01,050
wanted to add a second field. For example,

210
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:04,319
for a surname. So the way we normally do

211
00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:07,109
this is we add another key to the state.

212
00:13:07,109 --> 00:13:13,020
And we, uh, I'm going to copy and paste this

213
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:18,569
row. It's gonna say surname now. It's

214
00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:21,630
going to render a surname, and handleSurnameChange.

215
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,989
When I copy and paste

216
00:13:24,989 --> 00:13:30,260
this event handler, this will be surname.

217
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:42,810
And I need to bind it.

218
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:49,830
Okay, Mary Poppins. So we can see that it

219
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:54,180
works. Uh, so how do we do the same with

220
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:59,999
hooks? So one thing we could do is we

221
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:02,489
could make our state an object. As you

222
00:14:02,489 --> 00:14:05,310
can see that the state with hooks state

223
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,989
doesn't have to be an object. It can be

224
00:14:06,989 --> 00:14:09,090
any primitive. We could make it an object

225
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,460
if we wanted to, but we also don't have

226
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:15,300
to. So conceptually surname is, uh, is not

227
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:19,320
closely related to state, uh, to the name. So

228
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,150
what we could do is we could declare a

229
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:24,780
second state variable by calling the

230
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,719
useState hook again.

231
00:14:26,719 --> 00:14:29,940
So I'll declare surname. I can give it any

232
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,589
name, it's just the variable in my code.

233
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:37,050
And setSurname. Calling useState and

234
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,599
passing the initial state for that state

235
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:41,510
variable 'Poppins'.

236
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,800
So again I'm gonna copy and paste

237
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:51,060
the row. Say surname, the value surname,

238
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:55,680
handleSurnameChange. And when the user

239
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:03,089
edits the surname, not sir name, we want

240
00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:07,920
to set the surname.

241
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:14,300
Let's see if this works.

242
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:22,660
Yay, it looks like it works. [Applause]

243
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:26,630
So we can see that we can use hooks more

244
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,960
than once in a component. Let's compare

245
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,400
the two approaches in more detail. So on

246
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,040
the left familiar class component state

247
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,010
is always an object, has multiple fields,

248
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,620
may call setState will merge some

249
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,770
something into that object. And then when

250
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,510
we want to access it, we do this dot

251
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:52,400
state dot something. On the right in the

252
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,760
example using hooks, we use the state

253
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,990
hook twice. And that declares two state

254
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,830
variables: name and surname. And whenever

255
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,560
we call setName or setSurname,

256
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,750
this tells React that it needs to

257
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,000
rerender this component, just like if we

258
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,850
called setState. And so the next time

259
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,370
React renders our components is going

260
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,580
to pass the current name and the current

261
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,510
surname to our component. And then we can

262
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,520
use it directly without accessing this

263
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:36,400
dot state dot something.

264
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,640
All right. So let's go back to our class

265
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,510
example. What else, what other features of

266
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:46,479
React we know? So another thing you

267
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:48,670
might want to do from a component is to

268
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:52,570
read context. So context, in case you're

269
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,849
not familiar, it's like, ur, kind of like

270
00:16:54,849 --> 00:16:57,489
global variables for a subtree. So it's

271
00:16:57,489 --> 00:17:00,130
useful for things like read the current

272
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:02,859
theme like visual theme or the current

273
00:17:02,859 --> 00:17:05,650
language that the user is using. And it's

274
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,050
useful to avoid passing everything

275
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:10,150
through props if you need all components

276
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:13,030
to be able to read some value. So we're

277
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:17,410
going to import ThemeContext and 

278
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,989
LocaleContext which I already declared in

279
00:17:19,989 --> 00:17:23,320
another file. And the API you've probably

280
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,900
most familiar with for consuming context,

281
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,219
especially if you have to consume

282
00:17:27,219 --> 00:17:30,040
multiple contexts, is the render prop API.

283
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,219
And it looks like this. So I'm going to

284
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:36,729
scroll down here. So we can choose ThemeContext

285
00:17:36,729 --> 00:17:40,589
Consumer that gives us the theme.

286
00:17:40,589 --> 00:17:43,420
In my case, it's just going to be a CSS

287
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:50,109
class. So I copy this, all this code

288
00:17:50,109 --> 00:17:55,450
inside the render prop. And I'm going to

289
00:17:55,450 --> 00:18:01,150
use className equals 'theme' . All right,

290
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,280
very old-timey. [Laughing]

291
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,770
And I also want to show the current

292
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,739
language, so I'm going to use

293
00:18:09,739 --> 00:18:18,290
LocaleContext Consumer. And it's going to

294
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:22,670
render another row, so I will copy and

295
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:27,969
paste this row, can say language.

296
00:18:27,969 --> 00:18:34,760
Language. And render it here. Okay, we can

297
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,550
see that context works. And that's

298
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,920
probably normally consume context. We

299
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,780
actually added a more convenient API for

300
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:45,800
accessing it in classes in 16.6. Ur, but

301
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,900
this is how you can see multiple

302
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:53,479
contexts. So let's look at the, at how we

303
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:57,469
could do this with hooks. So as we said

304
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,780
that, state is a fundamental feature of

305
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,690
React and this is why you can use state.

306
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:07,339
And so if we want to use context, I need

307
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:10,760
to import my contexts. So this is gonna

308
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:17,500
be a ThemeContext, LocaleContext. And

309
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,660
now if I want to use context from my

310
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:27,200
component, I can use context. And then to

311
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,239
get the current theme, I can use context

312
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:35,060
ThemeContext. And to get the current

313
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:39,410
locale I can use context LocaleContext.

314
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:42,560
And this doesn't just read the context,

315
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,719
it also subscribes the component to

316
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:47,690
updates to this context. But it just

317
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,880
gives me the current values, so I can, I

318
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:56,150
can put it into my CSS className. And I

319
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:05,270
can add the bro, that's language, and I can

320
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:09,240
put it here.

321
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:18,410
[Applause]

322
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:21,150
All right, so let's,let's compare the two

323
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:25,170
approaches. So this is the traditional

324
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:28,370
kind of render prop API.

325
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:31,140
It is very explicit about what it's

326
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,650
doing. But it does get a little bit

327
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,430
nested and you encounter this not just

328
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,930
with context with, with any kind of

329
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:44,880
render prop API. So with hooks, it

330
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,500
does the same thing. But it's flat. So we

331
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,359
just say we use this context in this

332
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:53,820
context and we get the theme and locale.

333
00:20:53,820 --> 00:21:00,120
And then we can use them. So you might be

334
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,979
wondering at this point how can React

335
00:21:01,979 --> 00:21:04,739
possibly know. For example, I have this two

336
00:21:04,739 --> 00:21:07,140
useState calls. So how does it know

337
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,390
which state variable corresponds to

338
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:13,770
which useState call. And the answer is

339
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,859
that React relies on the order of these

340
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:20,430
calls. This may be a little bit unusual.

341
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:24,630
And, ah, in order for this to work correctly,

342
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,940
there is a rule that you need to follow

343
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,450
when you use hooks. And the rule is that

344
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:34,170
you cannot call hook inside a condition.

345
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:36,690
It has to be at the top level of your

346
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:39,150
component. So if I do something like, if

347
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:43,380
props condition, and then I call the useState

348
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,989
hook here. We actually have a

349
00:21:45,989 --> 00:21:49,020
linter plugin that is going to complain

350
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,000
that 'This is not the correct way to use

351
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,050
hooks'. And we realize that this is an

352
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:59,640
unusual limitation, uh, but it is pretty

353
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,190
important for hooks tour correctly and

354
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,920
also to enable certain things that I

355
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,380
think will you will like that I will show

356
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,359
it later.

357
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:17,970
All right, so let's go back to our class.

358
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,040
So the other thing you might want to

359
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,880
reach for the class for is lifecycle

360
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,880
methods. So the most commonly use case

361
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,620
for lifecycle methods is you want to

362
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,710
perform some side effect such as firing

363
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:34,170
off request, performing some kind of

364
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:37,380
imperative DOM mutation interfacing with

365
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,570
the browser APIs. So you might want to

366
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,490
do something like this and you can't do

367
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,950
during rendering, because it's, it's not

368
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,579
rendered yet. So the way you do

369
00:22:46,579 --> 00:22:49,770
side effects in React is you declare a

370
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:52,200
lifecycle method like componentDidMount.

371
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:58,140
And then let's say that, uh, if, let me show

372
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,000
this. So you see at the top of the screen,

373
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,450
it says React App. So there is actually a

374
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:06,030
browser API that lets us update this. So

375
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:09,810
let's say we want the tab title to be

376
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:12,660
the name of the person and changed it as

377
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,810
I type. And so to set it initially I'm

378
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,670
going, uh, there is a browser API to do

379
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:21,089
this, is document.title equals

380
00:23:21,089 --> 00:23:24,720
this.state.name plus space plus

381
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,250
this.state.surname. So now we can

382
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:33,570
see it says Mary Poppins. But then if I,

383
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:37,110
if I edit it, it doesn't get

384
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,090
automatically updated, because I also

385
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,930
need to implement componentDitUpdate.

386
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,940
For the, uh, for the side effects to be

387
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,480
consistent with what I rendered. So I'm

388
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,060
going to declare componentDitUpdate,

389
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:57,150
and just copy and paste this.

390
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:00,440
All right, so now says Mary Poppins, but if I

391
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,560
started editing it, the document title

392
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,960
updates. And this is how we perform side

393
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:15,640
effects in a class.

394
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:21,830
So how do we do this with hooks. Well the

395
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,960
ability to perform side effects is

396
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,970
another core feature of React components.

397
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:32,779
So if we want to use an effect from our

398
00:24:32,779 --> 00:24:37,700
component. Make an import use effect from

399
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:43,760
React. And then we want to tell React

400
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,100
what to do after React has flushed our

401
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,740
components to the DOM. So we pass a

402
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,590
function which is where we perform our

403
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,110
effect. So I'm going to say document dot

404
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:57,610
title equals name plus space plus

405
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:05,150
surname. You can see it says Mary Poppins

406
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:10,100
here. And if I start editing it actually

407
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,769
updates.

408
00:25:11,769 --> 00:25:15,289
So what default useEffect runs both

409
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:18,799
after the initial render and after every

410
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,650
update. So by default it is consistent

411
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,980
with what here rendered. And you can opt

412
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,960
out of this behavior if like for

413
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,850
performance reasons and, or if you have

414
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:32,539
special logic. And Ryan's talk after me

415
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:37,910
will touch a little bit on this. So let's

416
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:43,700
compare the two approaches. So in the, in the

417
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,890
class we divide method ... we divide the

418
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:48,860
logic based on lifecycle method names. So

419
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,210
this is why we have componentDidMount,

420
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:51,799
componentDitUpdate, they fire at

421
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:54,560
different times. And we sometimes repeat

422
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,450
some logic between them, we could extract

423
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:58,519
it to a function but still we would have

424
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:00,890
to call it in two places and remember to

425
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:04,370
keep it consistent. And with, uh, with the

426
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:07,610
effect hook, the effects are consistent

427
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,650
by default although there is a way to

428
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:13,340
opt out of that. And not is that in the

429
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,350
class we need to access this dot state,

430
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,360
so there needs to be a special API to do

431
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,570
this. But in the effect example, we

432
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,070
actually don't need a special API to

433
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:24,040
access the state

434
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,470
variable. Because it's already in the

435
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,450
scope of the function. It is declared

436
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:31,270
right above. And this is why the effect

437
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:34,780
is declared inside the component rather

438
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:37,390
than the, rather than outside. Because

439
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:39,700
this gives us access to state variables,

440
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,520
ability to set them and anything else

441
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,130
like the current context value for

442
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:56,380
example, or any of these contexts. 

443
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,120
All right, so let's go back to the familiar

444
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,290
class example. Ur, another thing you might

445
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:04,180
want to use lifecycle methods for in a

446
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,750
class is subscriptions. So maybe you want

447
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,550
to subscribe to some kind of browser API

448
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:12,040
and it gives you some value, for example

449
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,250
the window size. And you want to update

450
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,500
the state in response to changes to this

451
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,440
value. And so the way we could do this in

452
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,800
a class, let's say that we want to, ur, that

453
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,590
we want to monitor the window width. So

454
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:30,610
I'm going to put width into state. This

455
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:35,560
window innerWidth browser API. And I

456
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,980
want to render it. Ur, let me copy and paste

457
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:47,800
this. So this is gonna say width. And I'm

458
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,750
going to render it here. It is this dot state

459
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:53,590
dot width. This is the width of the

460
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:57,860
window, not the width of Mary Poppins. [Laughing]

461
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:02,660
And I'm going to add a, ur, I'm going to add

462
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,580
an event listener, so we need to actually

463
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:08,090
listen to changes in the width. So at

464
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:12,670
window dot addEventListener.

465
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:15,560
I'm, I'm going to listen to the resize

466
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:20,749
event, handle resize. And I need to

467
00:28:20,749 --> 00:28:23,330
declare this event. And so this is where

468
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:27,350
we're going to update the width state, to

469
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:32,150
be window dot innerWidth. And we need

470
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:42,229
to bind it. And, uh, and I also need to

471
00:28:42,229 --> 00:28:44,269
unsubscribe. So I don't want a memory

472
00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:46,580
leak with like keeping these

473
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,140
subscriptions. I want to unsubscribe from

474
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,600
this event. So the way we do this in a

475
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,880
class is we create another lifecycle

476
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,650
method called componentWillUnmount. And

477
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,029
I'm going to copy and paste this logic

478
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:01,779
here, except this will 

479
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:05,299
removeEventListener. So we set up an event

480
00:29:05,299 --> 00:29:06,920
listener, and we remove the event

481
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,870
listener. And we can verify that this

482
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:11,479
actually works by dragging this. You see

483
00:29:11,479 --> 00:29:17,029
the width is changing. So it works. So

484
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:18,920
let's see how could ...  how we could do this

485
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:31,130
with hooks. So conceptually listening to

486
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:33,709
the window width has nothing to do with

487
00:29:33,709 --> 00:29:37,279
setting the document title. So that's why

488
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,320
we're not gonna put it in that effect.

489
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,330
It's conceptually completely separate

490
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:44,060
effect and just like we could use state

491
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,610
more than once to declare multiple state

492
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:49,580
variables, we can use effect more than

493
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:54,130
once to perform different side effects.

494
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:57,560
So I want to subscribe to window

495
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:05,259
addEventListener, resize, handleResize. And

496
00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:08,719
I'm gonna need to keep some state for

497
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:10,130
the current width.

498
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:12,140
So I'm actually going to declare another

499
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:17,330
state variable. So I'll say, ur, width and

500
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:23,390
setWidth. We get them by using state with

501
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:27,670
window innerWidth as the initial value.

502
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:32,450
And now in my handleResize function,

503
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:34,130
I'll just declare it here. Because it

504
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:37,489
isn't used anywhere else. And it's going

505
00:30:37,489 --> 00:30:44,180
to setWidth to the current width. Um, I

506
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,460
need to render it. So I'll copy

507
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:54,580
and paste this row. I'm gonna say width.

508
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:58,910
And finally I need to clean up after

509
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:02,060
this effect. So I need to specify how to

510
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,870
clean up. And again conceptually cleaning

511
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:08,779
up is part of this effect. So this effect

512
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:12,940
has a clean up place. And the order, you,

513
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:16,070
the way you can specify it is that any

514
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:21,549
effect can optionally return a function.

515
00:31:21,549 --> 00:31:25,970
And if it does return the function, then

516
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:28,039
React will call this function to clean

517
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:30,830
up after the effect. So this is where we

518
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:37,920
unsubscribe.

519
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,870
Okay, let's just verify that this

520
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:49,000
actually works. Yay. [Applause]

521
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:02,640
So let's compare the two approaches. On the left, we have a

522
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,690
familiar class component, ur, nothing

523
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:09,539
surprising there. We, we have some side

524
00:32:09,539 --> 00:32:12,720
effects, some related logic is split

525
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,360
apart. So we can see that document title

526
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,190
has been set here. But it's also being

527
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:19,680
set here. And then we subscribe to an

528
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,610
effect here.

529
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:23,220
Sorry, subscribe to the event here, but we

530
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,650
unsubscribe here. So these things need to

531
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:28,710
be in sync with each other. And then this

532
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:31,260
method contains two unrelated methods

533
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,950
two unrelated lines. So that me in the in

534
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,690
feature make it a bit difficult to test

535
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:41,039
them in isolation. But it looks very

536
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:46,350
familiar. So that's, that's nice. So this

537
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,660
code probably looks less familiar. But

538
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,039
let's take another look at what's going

539
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:54,150
on here. Ur, in with hooks we separate code

540
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:56,310
not based on the lifecycle method name,

541
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:59,700
but based on what the code is doing. So

542
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,680
we can see that there is one effect

543
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,289
which is we updated document title.

544
00:33:04,289 --> 00:33:06,090
That's one thing, this component can do.

545
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:09,360
And then there is another effect which

546
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,299
is subscribing to the window resize

547
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:14,610
event and update in the state when it

548
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:18,870
changes. And, ur, this effect has a cleanup

549
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:21,000
phase which means that when it's time to

550
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,549
remove this effect React removes it and

551
00:33:23,549 --> 00:33:26,730
avoids the memory leaks. And if you've

552
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,920
been carefully watching, you might notice

553
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,110
that since effect run after every render,

554
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:33,600
we're just gonna keep resubscribing. So

555
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,150
there is a way to optimize this. Uh, so

556
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:38,820
default is to be consistent, ur, which is

557
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,590
important. If you for example use some

558
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:44,039
prop here, I need to resubscribe to a different id from

559
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:46,350
props or something similar. But there is

560
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,360
a way to optimize it and opt out of this

561
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,250
behavior. And Ryan in the next

562
00:33:50,250 --> 00:34:02,730
talk will mention how to do it. 

563
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:07,020
All right, so there is one more thing that I want

564
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:10,830
to show here. So this component is

565
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:14,610
getting pretty large, and it's fine. So we

566
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,770
expect that since you now can do more in

567
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:19,380
function components, they will get larger

568
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:23,850
and that's totally okay. Um, but you might

569
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:25,950
want to reuse some of that logic in

570
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:28,620
other components or extract it or test

571
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:32,040
it separately. What's interesting though

572
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,640
is that hooks calls uh, they are just

573
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:40,650
function calls. And components they are

574
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:43,920
just functions. So how do you share your

575
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:47,550
logic between two functions? You extract

576
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:50,490
it to a different function. That's what

577
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:53,220
I'm going to do. You're going to copy and

578
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:58,050
paste this. And I'm going to create a new

579
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:04,890
function called useWindowWidth and I'll

580
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:08,220
just paste it here. And so we need the

581
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,350
width in our component in order to

582
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:14,550
render it. So I need to return it from

583
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:18,890
this function, which is the current width.

584
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:25,410
And then I can go back up. And I can say

585
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:35,640
const width equals useWindowWidth.

586
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,370
[Applause]

587
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:44,080
[Cheers]

588
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:51,020
So what is this function? We didn't do

589
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,060
anything special, we just extracted the

590
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:56,299
function. Uh, but there is a convention here.

591
00:35:56,299 --> 00:35:59,960
So we are calling this function a custom

592
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,610
hook. And by convention custom hook names

593
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:08,270
always start with use. And so there are

594
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:10,220
two reasons for this. We're now going to

595
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,890
like read your function name or to

596
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:15,590
string it or anything like this. But it

597
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,540
is an important convention because first

598
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:20,299
of all, this lets us lint automatically

599
00:36:20,299 --> 00:36:22,910
for violation of the first rule that I

600
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:25,340
described about call hooks unconditionally.

601
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,830
So if we didn't know if something is a

602
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,390
hook, then we wouldn't be able to do that.

603
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:33,200
And another reason is that if you just

604
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,720
look at the component code, you kind of

605
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,220
want to know if some function can have

606
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,470
some state inside of it. So it's

607
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:41,750
important that there is a convention is

608
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:44,210
, okay, use something it means that it's

609
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:47,870
potentially stateful. And here width gives

610
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:50,690
us the current width and subscribes us to

611
00:36:50,690 --> 00:37:00,020
updates through it. So if we wanted to, we

612
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,240
could even go further. It's probably not

613
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,460
necessary in this example, but I just

614
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,680
want to give you like a sense of what

615
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,190
you could do. Um, so let's say like maybe

616
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,930
setting the document title was a bit

617
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,820
more complicated and you wanted to like

618
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:17,090
extract it or test it separately. So I

619
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:20,390
could just copy and paste this. and I

620
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,580
could write a new custom hook. I'm gonna

621
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:29,450
call this one useDocumentTitle. And so

622
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:31,760
the name and surname don't really make

623
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,250
sense in the scope's context. We just want

624
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,440
to call this title. And this is going to

625
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,600
be an argument, so custom hooks are

626
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,640
javascript functions, so they can take

627
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,430
arguments and return values or not

628
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:46,700
return. So it is going to take title as

629
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,430
an argument. And now in my component, I

630
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:54,140
can say useDocumentTitle, name plus

631
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,810
surname.

632
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:59,420
In fact, I could go even further. So in

633
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,700
this case it's totally unnecessary, but

634
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,340
again, maybe our inputs were more

635
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,259
complicated, maybe we were tracking

636
00:38:06,259 --> 00:38:08,150
whether the input was focused and

637
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,730
blurred, whether it has been validated,

638
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:12,680
submitted and so on. So maybe we had some

639
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,600
more logic there we wanted to pull it

640
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,000
out of our components. Um, and reduce

641
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,950
duplication. And there is already some

642
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:21,049
duplication, so we have this like almost

643
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:24,860
identical event handlers. So what if we

644
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,600
could just, um, I'm going to delete one of

645
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,140
them and extract the other one. I'm going

646
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,970
to create a new hook, that I'm going to

647
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:37,850
call useFormInput. So this is my change

648
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:40,820
handler. Now I'll also copy and paste

649
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:45,890
this declaration. So this defines the

650
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:49,370
state for this input. And so it's no

651
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,890
longer name and setName. I'll just call

652
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:56,000
generically value and setValue. It's

653
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,460
going to take the initial value as an

654
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:02,960
argument. And this is just going to be a

655
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:09,529
handleChange, and this will setValue. So

656
00:39:09,529 --> 00:39:12,200
what do we want to get in order to use

657
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,539
this, uh, use an input in our component? We

658
00:39:14,539 --> 00:39:16,759
want to get the current value, and a

659
00:39:16,759 --> 00:39:18,740
change handler. These are the things that

660
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:21,890
we attach to the input. So let's just

661
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:26,230
return them. Um, return value and onChange

662
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:33,740
handleChange. So now if we go back up, we

663
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:39,009
can say name equals useFormInput Mary.

664
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:41,480
The name is going to be an object with

665
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:45,200
value and onChange fields. And surname

666
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:52,880
is useFormInput Poppins. So this is now

667
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,100
going to be named dot value and surname

668
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,289
dot value because this is where the

669
00:39:57,289 --> 00:40:00,710
string is. And so now I can remove this,

670
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:07,100
and I can spread over the name object.

671
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:12,060
Someone is laughing. [Laughing] All right. Let's just

672
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:15,960
verify it and break it, yeah it works. So

673
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,000
each time we call a hook, its state is

674
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,880
completely isolated. And this is because

675
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,040
we just rely on the order of hook calls,

676
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,290
and not on names or anything. So you can

677
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,390
call the same hook multiple times. Each

678
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:32,940
call will get its own local state. So

679
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,490
let's compare the two approaches for

680
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:45,720
the last time. Um, so on the left we have a

681
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,000
familiar class component, it has some,

682
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,600
some state in an object, bind some

683
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,810
methods, has some logic spread across

684
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:57,060
different lifecycle methods as a

685
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:02,520
bunch of event handlers, um, uses, um, uses

686
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,440
something things from the context and

687
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:11,310
render stuff. Um, pretty familiar. And on the

688
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:13,350
right pane, this may not look like the

689
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:17,130
React components were used to. But it

690
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:19,770
kind of makes sense. Even if you don't

691
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:21,270
know how these functions are implemented.

692
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:24,380
You can see okay it uses to form inputs, 

693
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:26,760
uses some context to get theme and

694
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,460
locale, it uses the window width and

695
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:33,240
document title, and it renders a bunch of

696
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,360
stuff. And if we want to. We can scroll

697
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,670
further and we can see okay, so this is

698
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:41,460
how the input works, this is how setting

699
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,340
the document title works, this is how the

700
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:47,520
window width subscription works. Or maybe

701
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,920
this could be an npm package and you

702
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,470
don't actually need to know that. All we

703
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:54,510
could pull it back into a component or

704
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,910
copy and paste between components. So

705
00:41:56,910 --> 00:42:00,060
hooks give you custom hooks, give you the

706
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,620
flexibility to create your own

707
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,710
abstractions that are not ...  they do not

708
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:08,100
inflate your React component tree and avoid

709
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:14,720
the wrapper hell.

710
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,610
[Applause]

711
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:22,010
[Applause]

712
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:23,749
[Applause]

713
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:27,630
And importantly these are not two

714
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:29,489
separate applications. So this is

715
00:42:29,489 --> 00:42:32,640
actually one application. So I have this

716
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,590
window open just to demonstrate that

717
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:37,650
classes can work side by side with hooks.

718
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:40,620
And while hooks represent our vision for

719
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:44,580
the future of React. Uh, we don't want to

720
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:47,789
make breaking changes like this. So we

721
00:42:47,789 --> 00:42:53,310
need to keep classes working. Ur, let's go

722
00:42:53,310 --> 00:43:02,189
back to you the slides. All right, now

723
00:43:02,189 --> 00:43:06,490
this is a slider you can actually tweet. [Laughing]

724
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:09,490
We present the Hooks proposal to you

725
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:10,660
today.

726
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:13,510
Uh, hooks let us to use all React features

727
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:16,750
without having to write a class. They do

728
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:19,600
not deprecated classes, but you have the

729
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,790
option to not have to write them. We

730
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:24,250
intend to cover all use cases for

731
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:27,070
classes with hooks as soon as possible.

732
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:29,320
There are a few that are missing, but

733
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,680
we're working on them. And hooks let you

734
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,140
reuse stateful logic, extracted out of

735
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:38,230
components, tested separately, reuse it

736
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:39,850
between different components without

737
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,850
introducing the wrapper hell. And again

738
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:44,560
importantly it's not a breaking change,

739
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,000
completely backwards compatible, strictly

740
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,240
addition ..., uh, additive. And you can find the,

741
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,700
we wrote the documentation for hooks, so

742
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:59,520
you can find it at this url. Um, and

743
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,340
we want to hear from you, the React

744
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,170
community wanna hear what you think

745
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:07,780
about hooks. Um, whether you like them or not.

746
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:10,420
And we realize that it's pretty hard to

747
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,070
give feedback without actually trying

748
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:17,100
them. So we built them, and we released

749
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:22,000
sixty ..., um, sixteen seven alpha. It's not a

750
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,760
major release, it's a minor release. But

751
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,730
in alpha where you can try hooks. And

752
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:30,700
we've been trying them in production at

753
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:33,610
Facebook for about a month. So we don't

754
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:36,910
expect major bugs there. But the APIs

755
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:40,570
themselves may change together with your

756
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:44,320
feedback. And I asked you not to rewrite

757
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,330
anything like not to rewrite their whole

758
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:50,560
apps with hooks. Because first of all it's,

759
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,400
it's a proposal. And second because

760
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,500
personally I, I find that it takes a bit

761
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,240
of a mind shift to start thinking in

762
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,360
hooks, and it might be a bit confusing if

763
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,310
you try to just take a class component

764
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:07,030
and convert it. But I do encourage you to

765
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:08,710
try using hooks in some of the newer

766
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:11,110
code that you write in and let us know

767
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:15,450
what you think. So,

768
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:16,310
thank you.

769
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:20,650
[Applause]

770
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:22,150
[Applause]

771
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:25,880
So in our view hooks represent our

772
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:30,800
vision for the future of React. But I

773
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,640
think they also represent the way we

774
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,540
move React forward. And that is we don't

775
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:43,190
do big rewrite. Uh, we want the new patterns

776
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:46,790
that we like better to coexist with the

777
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:49,820
old patterns, so that we can have gradual

778
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:52,940
migration and adoption just like you can

779
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:57,890
gradually adopt React itself. And this is

780
00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:00,350
almost the end of my talk. Uh, I want to end

781
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:11,690
it on a personal note. So I started

782
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:16,990
learning React about four years ago. And

783
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:20,980
one of my first questions was why JSX.

784
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:25,520
Uh, but my second one of the next questions

785
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,730
was I can figure out what does the logo

786
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:32,180
have to do with React. So the project is

787
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:35,660
not called Atom, it's not a physics

788
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,610
engine.

789
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:40,670
Um, so one interpretation is that it's kind

790
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:41,630
of upon on

791
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:44,330
reactions, so atoms participate in

792
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:48,140
chemical reactions, reactions -> React. Um, but

793
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:50,090
it's not a claim with React actually

794
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:52,400
got it, uh, I found a different interpretation

795
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,770
that made more sense to me. And the way I

796
00:46:57,770 --> 00:46:59,980
think about it, uh,

797
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:02,930
we know that physical matter consists of

798
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:07,010
atoms. And we've learned that it's the

799
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:08,750
types of these atoms and their

800
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:11,600
properties that determine how the

801
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:15,160
physical matter looks and behaves. And

802
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,600
React has taught me something similar, 

803
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,330
that you can take a user interface and

804
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:23,120
you can split it into these independent

805
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:26,480
units called components, and it's the

806
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,000
types and properties of these components

807
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
that can describe how the user interface

808
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,290
looks and behaves.

809
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:38,270
What's ironic though is that the word

810
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:43,580
'atom', it literally means indivisible. So

811
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:45,560
when scientists just discovered atom for

812
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,090
the first time, they thought this is the

813
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:50,690
smallest thing we're gonna find. But

814
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:53,720
later they discovered an electron, which

815
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,840
is a smaller particle inside the atom.

816
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,580
And it turned out it actually electrons

817
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:03,770
explain a lot about how atoms work. And I

818
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:05,980
kind of feel the same way about hooks. I

819
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:10,000
don't feel like hooks are a new feature.

820
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,370
Rather I feel that hooks provide me with

821
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:15,830
access to React features that I already

822
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:18,530
know, such as state and context and lifecycle.

823
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:26,300
And I feel like hooks are a more

824
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:29,290
direct representation of React. And that

825
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:32,780
they really explain how a component

826
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:36,230
works inside. And I feel like they've

827
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:38,750
been hiding in plain sight for four

828
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:41,930
years. And in fact if you look at the

829
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:44,660
React logo, you can see those electron

830
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:47,510
orbits there. So maybe hooks have been

831
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:51,600
there all along. Thank you.

832
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:57,440
[Applause]

833
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:04,620
[Applause]

834
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:07,270
Dan, thank you so much. Sophie thank you

835
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:09,000
as well.
