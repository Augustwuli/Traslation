00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,550
Hi. Ah, my name is Dan, I work on the React

2
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,759
Team and this is my first time in React

3
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:28,160
Conf. [Applause] And so Sophie talked about these

4
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,740
problems that I think most of you have

5
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,280
encountered in React development. And of

6
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,629
course we could approach these problems

7
00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:38,509
one by one, so we could try to solve them

8
00:00:38,509 --> 00:00:41,840
in isolation. But it seems like solving

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,829
one of them makes some other one worse.

10
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:48,199
So for example, if we try to solve the

11
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:51,079
wrapper hell by putting more logic into

12
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:53,780
components themselves, then our

13
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,879
components become larger and harder to

14
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:58,879
refactor. And then on the other hand, if

15
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,910
we try to split the components apart

16
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:06,019
into smaller pieces and reuse those, then

17
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:07,550
we end up with more nests than in the

18
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,139
component tree and we get the wrapper

19
00:01:09,139 --> 00:01:13,519
hell again. And finally in either case we

20
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:15,499
have all the confusion that comes with

21
00:01:15,499 --> 00:01:18,230
the classes. So we think that this is

22
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,910
because these are not three separate

23
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,660
problems. We think that this is, ah, these are

24
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:27,470
three symptoms of one problem. And the

25
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,749
problem is that React does not provide a

26
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:34,850
simpler, smaller, lightweight primitive to

27
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,670
add state or lifecycle than a class

28
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:41,360
component. And so once you add a class

29
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,420
component, you can split it up further

30
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,190
without introducing the wrapper hell. And

31
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,889
in fact it's not a new problem. So if you

32
00:01:51,889 --> 00:01:54,530
use React for like more than a couple of

33
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,050
years, you might remember then when React

34
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,329
came out it actually included a solution

35
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:03,110
to this problem. Ah, it was mixins. So

36
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,499
mixins allow you to reuse some methods

37
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:08,060
between classes and this way you

38
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,610
wouldn't have all these wrappers. So

39
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:16,790
should we add mixins back to React? [Yeah ... No...]

40
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:20,310
That's right, no no, we're not gonna do

41
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,040
that. Ah, I mean the codes using mixins

42
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,230
the rounds, it's not like, it's not broken.

43
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,600
But we don't encourage using mixins in

44
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,880
React. And if you curious why there is a

45
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,910
blog post, uh, that we wrote code called

46
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,040
"Mixins Considered Harmful" on the React

47
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,910
Blog, where we explain that we think in

48
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,420
our experience, the problems that mixins

49
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,000
create are worse than the problems that

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,790
they solve. Ah, so that's why we don't

51
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,870
encourage using mixins. So perhaps we

52
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,310
could just can't solve this problem

53
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,860
maybe its inherent to the React

54
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,780
component model. Maybe we should just

55
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:10,470
accept it. [Laughing] Or maybe in there is a, perhaps

56
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,510
there is a different way we could write

57
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,720
our components that doesn't suffer from

58
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,200
either of these problems. And that's what

59
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,680
I'm going to talk about today. But before

60
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,840
I start I want to touch a little bit on

61
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,960
the way we approach making changes and

62
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,200
additions to React which is a year ago

63
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,290
we set up an RFC process, so RFC stands

64
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,840
for request for comments, and it means

65
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,880
that whenever we want to make or

66
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,680
somebody else wants to make a

67
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,620
substantial change or addition to React,

68
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,830
they need to write up a proposal with

69
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,260
detail in the motivation and the

70
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,660
detailed design of how this will work.

71
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,250
And so that's what we're going to do.

72
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,520
We're excited to announce that we are

73
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,040
ready to present a proposal for how we

74
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,520
can solve these three problems.

75
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,420
And importantly this proposal does not

76
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,820
have breaking changes or deprecations in

77
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,990
it. It is strictly additive, it is opt-in, 

78
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:20,790
and it adds some new APIs which happens
 
79
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,610
when they try to solve problems. And we

80
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,709
would love to hear your feedback on this

81
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:28,620
proposal which is why we're, ur, we're going

82
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,440
to publish it today. And we thought about

83
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,510
many ways we could share this proposal,

84
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,370
so maybe we just like write off in there ...

85
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,240
write up an RFC and post it. Um, but since we

86
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,700
were going to run React Conf anyway, we

87
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,650
just decided to, ah, just show it here. And

88
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:49,710
we're going to demo.

89
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:59,479
[Applause]

90
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:06,929
It already mirrors the displays. Sorry,

91
00:05:06,929 --> 00:05:19,670
technical glitch.

92
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,280
Ur, can somebody who understands projectors

93
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:33,250
help me. [Laughing] Ur, can I make it mirror my desktop?

94
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:41,290
Please.

95
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:46,970
(I can do it) Yeah. [Laughing]

96
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,370
Okay but it doesn't show on the screen, I

97
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,980
don't see anything. [Laughing]

98
00:05:53,980 --> 00:06:08,390
That's, that's the problem that I had.  [Applause]

99
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:17,180
Okay, disaster averted. [Laughing]

100
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:22,020
All right, um, let me check the font size a

101
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:27,960
little bit. Do you see this file? [Yeah] All right.

102
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:34,140
So, ah, here is a simple React component, ah, that

103
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,840
just it is a row, this is just some

104
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,870
styling, and it it renders a person's

105
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,170
name. And so let's say that we want this

106
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:47,340
name to be editable. So how do you do it

107
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,560
in React normally? Well, like if we want

108
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,200
to add an input there we need to return

109
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,630
this component into a class, add some

110
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,400
local state to it, and let that state

111
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,740
drive the input. So that's exactly what

112
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,190
I'm going to do, uh, that's what we do today.

113
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,390
So I'm gonna do the export default class

114
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:12,720
Greeding extends React component. And so

115
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,910
I'm going to use only stable javaScript

116
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:20,840
syntax. So constructor props, super props.

117
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,670
This the state, going to initialize, ur,

118
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:30,960
name to Mary here. And I'm going to

119
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,320
declare a render method and copy and

120
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:41,950
paste this.

121
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,680
Sorry.

122
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,040
Okay. And so I want this to be instead of

123
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,450
just rendering the name, I want this

124
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,400
render an input. So I'm replacing

125
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,320
this by an input, and the value of the

126
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:00,450
input is this dot state dot name. And

127
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:03,160
if I make a change I want to call this

128
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,910
dot handleNameChange, that's going to

129
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:10,570
be my change caller. And I'm going to

130
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,330
declare it here, when the name changes we

131
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,660
call setState like we normally do. And

132
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,900
we set the name to e dot target dot

133
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:26,440
value. Right. So now if I edit the ... [TypeError In Page] Okay so

134
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:33,070
I, I need to bind ... [Laughing] Sorry I need to bind

135
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,940
the events on there. Okay so now I can

136
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,390
actually edit it and it works. So a

137
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,450
familiar class component is, uh, if you work

138
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,280
with React probably right a lot of

139
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:52,060
those. But let's take a step back. What if

140
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,300
we didn't have to write a class when we

141
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,420
wanted to use state. So I'm not sure how

142
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,800
that's gonna work. But I'll just start

143
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,560
with what I know, I want to render an

144
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,390
input. So I'm gonna put an input here. And

145
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,979
the input has a value and that value

146
00:09:08,979 --> 00:09:11,469
is the current name, so I'll just pass

147
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:14,710
name. I don't know where to get name from.

148
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:18,359
So it doesn't come from props, uh,

149
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:22,410
I'll just declare it, and I don't know,

150
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:26,200
I'll fill it in later. Uh, it's gonna have a

151
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,790
change caller there as well, so I'm going

152
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:33,089
to declare onChange handleNameChange.

153
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:38,229
And I'm adding a function here takes an

154
00:09:38,229 --> 00:09:42,160
event. And then here I want to tell React

155
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,430
to set the name to something, but again

156
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,200
I'm not sure how to do that from a

157
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,999
functional component. So I'll just call

158
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:51,280
something called setName.

159
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:57,010
With the current input value. And I'll

160
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:06,570
just declare it here.

161
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,040
All right, so these two things they're

162
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,080
closely related, right. So one of them is

163
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,630
the current value of the name state

164
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:17,440
variable and the other is a function

165
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,700
that lets us set the name state variable.

166
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,930
And so because these things are closely

167
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,820
related, I'm actually going to put them

168
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:29,950
together as a pair of values. So I'm

169
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,390
going to get them together from

170
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:35,220
somewhere. So where do I get them from?

171
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:40,050
From React local state. So how do I use

172
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,370
React local state from a function

173
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:46,960
component? Well, what if I could just use

174
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:53,940
state.

175
00:10:53,940 --> 00:11:01,230
And past the initial state to specify it.

176
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:08,010
Let's see if this works. Yeah, it works.

177
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:17,310
[Applause & Cheers]

178
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,630
So let's, let's compare the two

179
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:25,120
approaches. So on the left we have a

180
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,700
familiar class component. This state has

181
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,180
to be an object. Uh, we bind some event

182
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,160
handlers so that we can access. This

183
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,099
inside the event handler for this dot setState.

184
00:11:36,099 --> 00:11:39,160
When we call setState it

185
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,020
actually doesn't just set the state that

186
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,620
merges, the state are the argument into

187
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,050
the state object. And then when we want

188
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,120
to access the state which is this dot

189
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,359
state dot something. So in the

190
00:11:52,359 --> 00:11:55,359
example on the right, we don't need to

191
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:57,940
access this dot state dot something.

192
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,339
Because the name state variable is

193
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:02,530
already available in the function. It's

194
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:05,440
just the variable. And similarly when we

195
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,540
need to set the state, we don't need to

196
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,320
access this dot something. Because the

197
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,450
function that let us set the name is

198
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:19,270
also available in the scope. So what is

199
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:25,560
useState exactly? UseState is a hook. A

200
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,200
hook is a function provided by React

201
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,670
that lets you hook into React features

202
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,999
from your function components. And

203
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:38,979
useState is the first hook that we're going

204
00:12:38,979 --> 00:12:40,870
to take a look at today, but there are a

205
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,089
few more. So we're going to see them

206
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:52,250
later.

207
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,630
All right, so let's go back to our

208
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:58,170
familiar class example. So let's say we

209
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:01,050
wanted to add a second field. For example,

210
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:04,319
for a surname. So the way we normally do

211
00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:07,109
this is we add another key to the state.

212
00:13:07,109 --> 00:13:13,020
And we, uh, I'm going to copy and paste this

213
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:18,569
row. It's gonna say surname now. It's

214
00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:21,630
going to render a surname, and handleSurnameChange.

215
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,989
When I copy and paste

216
00:13:24,989 --> 00:13:30,260
this event handler, this will be surname.

217
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:42,810
And I need to bind it.

218
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:49,830
Okay, Mary Poppins. So we can see that it

219
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:54,180
works. Uh, so how do we do the same with

220
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:59,999
hooks? So one thing we could do is we

221
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:02,489
could make our state an object. As you

222
00:14:02,489 --> 00:14:05,310
can see that the state with hooks state

223
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,989
doesn't have to be an object. It can be

224
00:14:06,989 --> 00:14:09,090
any primitive. We could make it an object

225
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,460
if we wanted to, but we also don't have

226
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:15,300
to. So conceptually surname is, uh, is not

227
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:19,320
closely related to state, uh, to the name. So

228
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,150
what we could do is we could declare a

229
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:24,780
second state variable by calling the

230
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,719
useState hook again.

231
00:14:26,719 --> 00:14:29,940
So I'll declare surname. I can give it any

232
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,589
name, it's just the variable in my code.

233
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:37,050
And setSurname. Calling useState and

234
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,599
passing the initial state for that state

235
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:41,510
variable 'Poppins'.

236
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,800
So again I'm gonna copy and paste

237
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:51,060
the row. Say surname, the value surname,

238
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:55,680
handleSurnameChange. And when the user

239
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:03,089
edits the surname, not sir name, we want

240
00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:07,920
to set the surname.

241
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:14,300
Let's see if this works.

242
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:22,660
Yay, it looks like it works. [Applause]

243
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:26,630
So we can see that we can use hooks more

244
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,960
than once in a component. Let's compare

245
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,400
the two approaches in more detail. So on

246
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,040
the left familiar class component state

247
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,010
is always an object, has multiple fields,

248
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,620
may call setState will merge some

249
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,770
something into that object. And then when

250
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,510
we want to access it, we do this dot

251
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:52,400
state dot something. On the right in the

252
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,760
example using hooks, we use the state

253
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,990
hook twice. And that declares two state

254
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,830
variables: name and surname. And whenever

255
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,560
we call setName or setSurname,

256
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,750
this tells React that it needs to

257
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,000
rerender this component, just like if we

258
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,850
called setState. And so the next time

259
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,370
React renders our components is going

260
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,580
to pass the current name and the current

261
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,510
surname to our component. And then we can

262
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,520
use it directly without accessing this

263
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:36,400
dot state dot something.

264
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,640
All right. So let's go back to our class

265
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,510
example. What else, what other features of

266
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:46,479
React we know? So another thing you

267
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:48,670
might want to do from a component is to

268
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:52,570
read context. So context, in case you're

269
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,849
not familiar, it's like, ur, kind of like

270
00:16:54,849 --> 00:16:57,489
global variables for a subtree. So it's

271
00:16:57,489 --> 00:17:00,130
useful for things like read the current

272
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:02,859
theme like visual theme or the current

273
00:17:02,859 --> 00:17:05,650
language that the user is using. And it's

274
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,050
useful to avoid passing everything

275
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:10,150
through props if you need all components

276
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:13,030
to be able to read some value. So we're

277
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:17,410
going to import ThemeContext and 

278
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,989
LocaleContext which I already declared in

279
00:17:19,989 --> 00:17:23,320
another file. And the API you've probably

280
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,900
most familiar with for consuming context,

281
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,219
especially if you have to consume

282
00:17:27,219 --> 00:17:30,040
multiple contexts, is the render prop API.

283
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,219
And it looks like this. So I'm going to

284
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:36,729
scroll down here. So we can choose ThemeContext

285
00:17:36,729 --> 00:17:40,589
Consumer that gives us the theme.

286
00:17:40,589 --> 00:17:43,420
In my case, it's just going to be a CSS

287
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:50,109
class. So I copy this, all this code

288
00:17:50,109 --> 00:17:55,450
inside the render prop. And I'm going to

289
00:17:55,450 --> 00:18:01,150
use className equals 'theme' . All right,

290
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,280
very old-timey. [Laughing]

291
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,770
And I also want to show the current

292
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,739
language, so I'm going to use

293
00:18:09,739 --> 00:18:18,290
LocaleContext Consumer. And it's going to

294
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:22,670
render another row, so I will copy and

295
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:27,969
paste this row, can say language.

296
00:18:27,969 --> 00:18:34,760
Language. And render it here. Okay, we can

297
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,550
see that context works. And that's

298
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,920
probably normally consume context. We

299
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,780
actually added a more convenient API for

300
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:45,800
accessing it in classes in 16.6. Ur, but

301
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,900
this is how you can see multiple

302
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:53,479
contexts. So let's look at the, at how we

303
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:57,469
could do this with hooks. So as we said

304
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,780
that, state is a fundamental feature of

305
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,690
React and this is why you can use state.

306
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:07,339
And so if we want to use context, I need

307
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:10,760
to import my contexts. So this is gonna

308
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:17,500
be a ThemeContext, LocaleContext. And

309
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,660
now if I want to use context from my

310
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:27,200
component, I can use context. And then to

311
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,239
get the current theme, I can use context

312
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:35,060
ThemeContext. And to get the current

313
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:39,410
locale I can use context LocaleContext.

314
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:42,560
And this doesn't just read the context,

315
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,719
it also subscribes the component to

316
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:47,690
updates to this context. But it just

317
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,880
gives me the current values, so I can, I

318
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:56,150
can put it into my CSS className. And I

319
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:05,270
can add the bro, that's language, and I can

320
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:09,240
put it here.

321
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:18,410
[Applause]

322
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:21,150
那么，让我们，让我们比较这两个

323
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:25,170
方法。这是传统的

324
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:28,370
render prop API 的使用方式。

325
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:31,140
非常清楚地显示了它正在做什么。

326
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,650
但是它还包含了一点点的

327
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,430
嵌套，而且你遇到的不只有

328
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,930
任何一种

329
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:44,880
render prop API。所以使用 hooks，它

330
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,500
也能做同样的事情。但是会有些单调。所以我们

331
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,359
就说我们使用这个 context 在这个

332
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:53,820
context 中，并且我们得到了 theme 和 locale。

333
00:20:53,820 --> 00:21:00,120
然后我们可以使用它们了。然后，你可能

334
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,979
想问 React 是如何

335
00:21:01,979 --> 00:21:04,739
知道的。例如，我在这调用了两个

336
00:21:04,739 --> 00:21:07,140
useState。所以它是如何知道

337
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,390
哪一个 state 和调用的哪一个

338
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:13,770
useState 是相一致的。答案是

339
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,859
React 依赖于这些

340
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:20,430
调用的顺序。这可能有一点不太寻常。

341
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:24,630
为了让它正确地运行起来。

342
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,940
当你在使用 hooks 的时候，这儿有一条你需要去遵循的规则。

343
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,450
这条规则就是

344
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:34,170
你不能在条件里面调用 hook。

345
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:36,690
它必须在你的组件的顶层。

346
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:39,150
所以如果我做一些类似于

347
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:43,380
props 条件，然后我在这调用 useState

348
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,989
hook。我们实际上拥有一个

349
00:21:45,989 --> 00:21:49,020
linter 插件用来提示

350
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,000
'This is not the correct way to use

351
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,050
hooks'。我们意识到这是一个 

352
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:59,640
不同寻常的限制，嗯，但是这对正确地使用

353
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,190
hooks 十分重要，也

354
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,920
可以使事情变得更明确，我

355
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,380
认为你们会喜欢它的，我等会儿会向你们

356
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,359
展示它。

357
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:17,970
那么，让我们回头看看我们的 class。

358
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,040
你使用 class 想要

359
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,880
达到的另一件事可能就是生命周期

360
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,880
方法。所以最普遍的

361
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,620
生命周期方法的案例就是你想要

362
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,710
执行一些 sideEffect，例如发送

363
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:34,170
请求，执行一些

364
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:37,380
使用浏览器 API 的必要的 DOM 转换接口

365
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,570
所以，你可能想要

366
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,490
做一些类似于这个，但是你不能使用

367
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,950
渲染。因为它还不能

368
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,579
被渲染。所以，你在 React 中使用

369
00:22:46,579 --> 00:22:49,770
side effects 的方法是你声明一个

370
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:52,200
类似于 componentDidMount 的生命周期方法。

371
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:58,140
那么比如说，嗯，让我向你们展示一下

372
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,000
这个。那么，你看到在屏幕的顶部，

373
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,450
它显示的是 React App。这里实际上拥有一个

374
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:06,030
使我们更新这个的浏览器 API。

375
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:09,810
比如说我们想要这个 tab 的标题变成

376
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:12,660
这个人的名字并且随着我定义的值而改变。

377
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,810
然后，现在我要初始化它

378
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,670
嗯，这儿有一个浏览器 API 可以做

379
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:21,089
这件事，那就是 document.title 等于

380
00:23:21,089 --> 00:23:24,720
this.state.name 加空格加

381
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,250
this.state.surname。那么现在我们可以

382
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:33,570
看见这里显示 Mary Poppins。但是如果我现在，

383
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:37,110
如果我编辑它，它不会

384
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,090
自动地更新，因为我也

385
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,930
需要 implement componentDitUpdate。

386
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,940
为了让 side effect 变得

387
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,480
和我渲染的一致，所以我

388
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,060
将要声明 componentDitUpdate,

389
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:57,150
就只要复制和粘贴到这。

390
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:00,440
那么，现在说 Mary Poppins，但是如果我

391
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,560
开始编辑它，这个文档的标题也更新了。

392
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,960
这就是我们如何在一个

393
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:15,640
class 里执行一个 side effect 了。

394
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:21,830
所以我们要如何用 hooks 实现它呢。

395
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,960
执行 side effect 是 

396
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,970
React 组件的另一个核心特点。

397
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:32,779
所以如果我们想要使用我们的

398
00:24:32,779 --> 00:24:37,700
组件的效果，需要从 React 里 import 一个 useEffect。

399
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:43,760
然后我们要告诉 React

400
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,100
在 React 清除组件之后

401
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,740
对 DOM 做什么。所以我们通过一个

402
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,590
在我们执行 effect 的时候的函数

403
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,110
所以我设置 document.

404
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:57,610
title 等于 name 加上空格加上

405
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:05,150
surname。你们可以看到这儿就显示了 Mary Poppins。

406
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:10,100
然后如果我开始编辑它，它实际上也会

407
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,769
更新。

408
00:25:11,769 --> 00:25:15,289
所以要使默认的 userEffect 运行起来

409
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:18,799
需要在初始化渲染和每一次

410
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,650
更新之后。所以通过默认设置他会和

411
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,980
这儿渲染什么相一致。

412
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,960
如果出于考虑性能原因

413
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,850
或者你有特殊的逻辑，可以选择不采用这种行为。

414
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:32,539
在我之后，Ryan 的演讲

415
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:37,910
将会谈到一些关于这个的内容。所以，让我们

416
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:43,700
比较这两个方法。在这个，这个

417
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,890
类里，我们将函数分开。我们

418
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:48,860
基于生命周期函数名将逻辑分开。所以

419
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,210
这是我们为什么会有 componentDidMount,

420
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:51,799
componentDitUpdate 的原因。他们在

421
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:54,560
不同的时间上被触发。我们有时候

422
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,450
在他们之间重复一些逻辑。我们可以把

423
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:58,519
它放进一个函数里，但是我们仍然不得不

424
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:00,890
在两个地方调用它，而且要记得

425
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:04,370
保持一致。通过，通过使用

426
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:07,610
effect hook，效果会和

427
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,650
默认的保持一致。即使这有个办法

428
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:13,340
能够不采用这个方法。并不是说

429
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,350
在类中我们需要访问 this.state，

430
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,360
所以需要一个特殊的 API 来完成

431
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,570
这个。但是在这个 effect 例子中，我们

432
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,070
实际上不需要一个特殊的 API 去

433
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:24,040
访问这个 state

434
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,470
变量。因为它已经在

435
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,450
这个函数的范围内。它被声明在

436
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:31,270
右边。这就是 the effect

437
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:34,780
被声明在这个 component 里，而

438
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:37,390
不是，不是在外面的原因。因为

439
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:39,700
这样我们能够访问 state 变量，

440
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,520
能够去设置他们和任何其他

441
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,130
像当前上下文的值。例如，

442
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:56,380
这些上下文的其中一个。

443
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,120
那么，我们回头看看熟悉的

444
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,290
类的例子。嗯，其他你可能

445
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:04,180
想要做的事是使用生命周期方法

446
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,750
在类被使用的时候。所以你可能想要

447
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,550
去订阅一些浏览器 API，

448
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:12,040
然后它会提供给你一些值，例如

449
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,250
窗口的大小。然后你想要更新

450
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,500
这个 state 对该值的改变做出反应。

451
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,440
所以我们可以在一个类里使用这个方法

452
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,800
比如说我们想要，嗯，

453
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,590
我们想要监测窗口的宽度。所以

454
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:30,610
我将 width 放进 state 里。这个

455
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:35,560
window.innerWidth 浏览器 API。然后我

456
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,980
想要渲染它。嗯，让我们复制并且粘贴

457
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:47,800
这个。所以这个将会展示 width。我将

458
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,750
在这个地方渲染它。它是 this.state

459
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:53,590
width。这就是窗口的宽度了，

460
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:57,860
而不是 Mary Poppins 的宽度。 [大笑]

461
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:02,660
我将添加一个，嗯，我将要添加

462
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,580
一个事件监听，所以我们需要真真切切地

463
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:08,090
监听这个 width 的改变。所以设置

464
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:12,670
window.addEventListener。

465
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:15,560
我，我将监听 resize 事件，

466
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:20,749
handleResize。然后我需要

467
00:28:20,749 --> 00:28:23,330
声明这个事件。所以在这儿

468
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:27,350
我们将更新这个 width 状态，变成

469
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:32,150
window.innerWidth。然后我们需要

470
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:42,229
去绑定它。然后，嗯，然后我也需要

471
00:28:42,229 --> 00:28:44,269
取消订阅。所以我不想要一个内存

472
00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:46,580
泄漏比如说保留这些

473
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,140
订阅。我想要从这个事件取消订阅。

474
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,600
所以我们在一个类里做这个的办法

475
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,880
是我们创建其他

476
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,650
叫做 componentWillUnmount 的生命周期方法。然后

477
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,029
我将复制并且粘贴这段逻辑逻辑代码

478
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:01,779
到这，将这个替换成 

479
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:05,299
removeEventListener。所以我们设置了一个事件

480
00:29:05,299 --> 00:29:06,920
监听，然后我们移除这个事件

481
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,870
监听。然后我们可以

482
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:11,479
通过拖动来验证这一点。你看到

483
00:29:11,479 --> 00:29:17,029
这个 width 正在变化。所以它起效果了。所以

484
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:18,920
让我们看看如何可以，我们如何

485
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:31,130
用 hooks 实现这个。因此，从概念上来说，监听

486
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:33,709
窗口宽度

487
00:29:33,709 --> 00:29:37,279
与设置文档标题无关。所以这就是为什么

488
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,320
我们没有把它放入 effect 的原因。

489
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,330
这在概念上是完全独立的 effect，

490
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:44,060
就像我们可以使用不止一次的 useState 用来

491
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,610
去声明多种 state 

492
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:49,580
变量，我们可以使用不止一次的 useEffect

493
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:54,130
去实现不同的 side effects。

494
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:57,560
所以我想要订阅 window.

495
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:05,259
addEventListener，resize，handleResize。然后

496
00:30:05,259 --> 00:30:08,719
我需要保存一些

497
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:10,130
当前 width 的状态。

498
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:12,140
所以，我将声明其他的

499
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:17,330
 state 变量。所以我提到，嗯，width 和

500
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:23,390
setWidth。我们通过 useState

501
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:27,670
设置他们的初始值为 window.innerWidth。

502
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:32,450
现在，在我的 handleResize 函数里,

503
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:34,130
我将在这声明它。因为它

504
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:37,489
没有在其他地方被使用。然后用

505
00:30:37,489 --> 00:30:44,180
setWidth 去设置它当前的 width。嗯，我

506
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,460
需要去渲染它。所以我复制

507
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:54,580
并粘贴这个 row。我在这儿写 width。 

508
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:58,910
最后我需要在这个 

509
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:02,060
effect 之后去清除它。所以我需要指定如何

510
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,870
清除。再一次从概念上说，清除

511
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:08,779
也是这个 effect 的一部分。所以这个 effect

512
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:12,940
有一个清除的地方。这个顺序，你，

513
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:16,070
你可以提出的办法是任何

514
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:21,549
effect 可以选择返回一个函数。

515
00:31:21,549 --> 00:31:25,970
如果它返回一个函数，那么

516
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:28,039
React 将调用这个函数

517
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:30,830
在 effect 之后清除。所以这就是我们

518
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:37,920
取消订阅的地方。

519
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,870
Ok，让我们验证一下

520
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:49,000
这个实际的操作吧。耶！[鼓掌]

521
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:02,640
那么让我们比较这两个方法。在左边，我们使用了一个

522
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,690
熟悉的 class 组件，嗯，在这没有

523
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:09,539
令人惊喜的东西。我们，我们有一些 side

524
00:32:09,539 --> 00:32:12,720
effects，一些和逻辑相关的是分开

525
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,360
的部分。所以我们可以看见文档的标题

526
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,190
在这儿被设置。但是它在这也

527
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:19,680
被设置了。然后我们在这订阅一个

528
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,610
effect。

529
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:23,220
抱歉，在这订阅这个事件，但是我们

530
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,650
在这取消订阅。所以这些事情需要

531
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:28,710
相互同步。然后这个

532
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:31,260
方法包含了两个不相关的方法

533
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,950
在这不相关的两行中。因此，我，在，在

534
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,690
特点上孤立地测试他们有点难。

535
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:41,039
但是它看起来非常的令人熟悉。

536
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:46,350
所以，这，这很棒。所以这段

537
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,660
代码看起来可能会更不怎么熟悉。但是

538
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,039
让我们再看一看这里发生了什么。

539
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:54,150
嗯，在 hooks 中，我们分离代码

540
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:56,310
不是基于生命周期函数的名字，

541
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:59,700
而是基于这段代码要做什么。所以

542
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,680
我们可以看到这个有一个 effect 

543
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,289
我们用来更新文档的标题

544
00:33:04,289 --> 00:33:06,090
这是一件 compnent 能做的事。

545
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:09,360
然后这儿有另一个

546
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,299
被订阅用于 window resize 时间的 effect 

547
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:14,610
并且当它被改变时在这个 state 里被更新。

548
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:18,870
然后，嗯，这个 effect 有一个清除

549
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:21,000
阶段，意味着什么时候该去

550
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,549
移除这个 effect，React 移除它

551
00:33:23,549 --> 00:33:26,730
然后避免内存泄漏。如果你

552
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,920
一直仔细观察，你可能注意到

553
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,110
由于 effect 在每次渲染之后运行，

554
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:33,600
我们只是继续重新订阅。所以

555
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,150
这儿有一个方法去优化这个。嗯。所以

556
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:38,820
默认是一致的，嗯，这

557
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,590
很重要。如果你，例如在这使用一些

558
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:44,039
prop，我需要去重新注册一个不同的 id 

559
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:46,350
从道具或类似的东西。但是这儿有

560
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,360
一个方法去优化它并且选择不用这个

561
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,250
行为。然后 Ryan 在下一个

562
00:33:50,250 --> 00:34:02,730
演讲中将会提到如何去实现它。

563
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:07,020
All right, so there is one more thing that I want

564
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:10,830
to show here. So this component is

565
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:14,610
getting pretty large, and it's fine. So we

566
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,770
expect that since you now can do more in

567
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:19,380
function components, they will get larger

568
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:23,850
and that's totally okay. Um, but you might

569
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:25,950
want to reuse some of that logic in

570
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:28,620
other components or extract it or test

571
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:32,040
it separately. What's interesting though

572
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,640
is that hooks calls uh, they are just

573
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:40,650
function calls. And components they are

574
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:43,920
just functions. So how do you share your

575
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:47,550
logic between two functions? You extract

576
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:50,490
it to a different function. That's what

577
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:53,220
I'm going to do. You're going to copy and

578
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:58,050
paste this. And I'm going to create a new

579
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:04,890
function called useWindowWidth and I'll

580
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:08,220
just paste it here. And so we need the

581
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,350
width in our component in order to

582
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:14,550
render it. So I need to return it from

583
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:18,890
this function, which is the current width.

584
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:25,410
And then I can go back up. And I can say

585
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:35,640
const width equals useWindowWidth.

586
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,370
[Applause]

587
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:44,080
[Cheers]

588
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:51,020
So what is this function? We didn't do

589
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,060
anything special, we just extracted the

590
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:56,299
function. Uh, but there is a convention here.

591
00:35:56,299 --> 00:35:59,960
So we are calling this function a custom

592
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,610
hook. And by convention custom hook names

593
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:08,270
always start with use. And so there are

594
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:10,220
two reasons for this. We're now going to

595
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,890
like read your function name or to

596
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:15,590
string it or anything like this. But it

597
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,540
is an important convention because first

598
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:20,299
of all, this lets us lint automatically

599
00:36:20,299 --> 00:36:22,910
for violation of the first rule that I

600
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:25,340
described about call hooks unconditionally.

601
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,830
So if we didn't know if something is a

602
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,390
hook, then we wouldn't be able to do that.

603
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:33,200
And another reason is that if you just

604
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,720
look at the component code, you kind of

605
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,220
want to know if some function can have

606
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,470
some state inside of it. So it's

607
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:41,750
important that there is a convention is

608
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:44,210
, okay, use something it means that it's

609
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:47,870
potentially stateful. And here width gives

610
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:50,690
us the current width and subscribes us to

611
00:36:50,690 --> 00:37:00,020
updates through it. So if we wanted to, we

612
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,240
could even go further. It's probably not

613
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,460
necessary in this example, but I just

614
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,680
want to give you like a sense of what

615
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,190
you could do. Um, so let's say like maybe

616
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,930
setting the document title was a bit

617
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,820
more complicated and you wanted to like

618
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:17,090
extract it or test it separately. So I

619
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:20,390
could just copy and paste this. and I

620
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,580
could write a new custom hook. I'm gonna

621
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:29,450
call this one useDocumentTitle. And so

622
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:31,760
the name and surname don't really make

623
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,250
sense in the scope's context. We just want

624
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,440
to call this title. And this is going to

625
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,600
be an argument, so custom hooks are

626
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,640
javascript functions, so they can take

627
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,430
arguments and return values or not

628
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:46,700
return. So it is going to take title as

629
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,430
an argument. And now in my component, I

630
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:54,140
can say useDocumentTitle, name plus

631
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,810
surname.

632
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:59,420
In fact, I could go even further. So in

633
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,700
this case it's totally unnecessary, but

634
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,340
again, maybe our inputs were more

635
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,259
complicated, maybe we were tracking

636
00:38:06,259 --> 00:38:08,150
whether the input was focused and

637
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,730
blurred, whether it has been validated,

638
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:12,680
submitted and so on. So maybe we had some

639
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,600
more logic there we wanted to pull it

640
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,000
out of our components. Um, and reduce

641
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,950
duplication. And there is already some

642
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:21,049
duplication, so we have this like almost

643
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:24,860
identical event handlers. So what if we

644
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,600
could just, um, I'm going to delete one of

645
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,140
them and extract the other one. I'm going

646
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,970
to create a new hook, that I'm going to

647
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:37,850
call useFormInput. So this is my change

648
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:40,820
handler. Now I'll also copy and paste

649
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:45,890
this declaration. So this defines the

650
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:49,370
state for this input. And so it's no

651
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,890
longer name and setName. I'll just call

652
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:56,000
generically value and setValue. It's

653
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,460
going to take the initial value as an

654
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:02,960
argument. And this is just going to be a

655
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:09,529
handleChange, and this will setValue. So

656
00:39:09,529 --> 00:39:12,200
what do we want to get in order to use

657
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,539
this, uh, use an input in our component? We

658
00:39:14,539 --> 00:39:16,759
want to get the current value, and a

659
00:39:16,759 --> 00:39:18,740
change handler. These are the things that

660
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:21,890
we attach to the input. So let's just

661
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:26,230
return them. Um, return value and onChange

662
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:33,740
handleChange. So now if we go back up, we

663
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:39,009
can say name equals useFormInput Mary.

664
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:41,480
The name is going to be an object with

665
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:45,200
value and onChange fields. And surname

666
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:52,880
is useFormInput Poppins. So this is now

667
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,100
going to be named dot value and surname

668
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,289
dot value because this is where the

669
00:39:57,289 --> 00:40:00,710
string is. And so now I can remove this,

670
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:07,100
and I can spread over the name object.

671
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:12,060
Someone is laughing. [Laughing] All right. Let's just

672
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:15,960
verify it and break it, yeah it works. So

673
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,000
each time we call a hook, its state is

674
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,880
completely isolated. And this is because

675
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,040
we just rely on the order of hook calls,

676
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,290
and not on names or anything. So you can

677
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,390
call the same hook multiple times. Each

678
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:32,940
call will get its own local state. So

679
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,490
let's compare the two approaches for

680
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:45,720
the last time. Um, so on the left we have a

681
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,000
familiar class component, it has some,

682
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,600
some state in an object, bind some

683
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,810
methods, has some logic spread across

684
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:57,060
different lifecycle methods as a

685
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:02,520
bunch of event handlers, um, uses, um, uses

686
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,440
something things from the context and

687
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:11,310
render stuff. Um, pretty familiar. And on the

688
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:13,350
right pane, this may not look like the

689
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:17,130
React components were used to. But it

690
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:19,770
kind of makes sense. Even if you don't

691
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:21,270
know how these functions are implemented.

692
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:24,380
You can see okay it uses to form inputs, 

693
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:26,760
uses some context to get theme and

694
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,460
locale, it uses the window width and

695
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:33,240
document title, and it renders a bunch of

696
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,360
stuff. And if we want to. We can scroll

697
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,670
further and we can see okay, so this is

698
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:41,460
how the input works, this is how setting

699
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,340
the document title works, this is how the

700
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:47,520
window width subscription works. Or maybe

701
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,920
this could be an npm package and you

702
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,470
don't actually need to know that. All we

703
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:54,510
could pull it back into a component or

704
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,910
copy and paste between components. So

705
00:41:56,910 --> 00:42:00,060
hooks give you custom hooks, give you the

706
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,620
flexibility to create your own

707
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,710
abstractions that are not ...  they do not

708
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:08,100
inflate your React component tree and avoid

709
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:14,720
the wrapper hell.

710
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,610
[Applause]

711
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:22,010
[Applause]

712
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:23,749
[Applause]

713
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:27,630
And importantly these are not two

714
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:29,489
separate applications. So this is

715
00:42:29,489 --> 00:42:32,640
actually one application. So I have this

716
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,590
window open just to demonstrate that

717
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:37,650
classes can work side by side with hooks.

718
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:40,620
And while hooks represent our vision for

719
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:44,580
the future of React. Uh, we don't want to

720
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:47,789
make breaking changes like this. So we

721
00:42:47,789 --> 00:42:53,310
need to keep classes working. Ur, let's go

722
00:42:53,310 --> 00:43:02,189
back to you the slides. All right, now

723
00:43:02,189 --> 00:43:06,490
this is a slider you can actually tweet. [Laughing]

724
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:09,490
We present the Hooks proposal to you

725
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:10,660
today.

726
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:13,510
Uh, hooks let us to use all React features

727
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:16,750
without having to write a class. They do

728
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:19,600
not deprecated classes, but you have the

729
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,790
option to not have to write them. We

730
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:24,250
intend to cover all use cases for

731
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:27,070
classes with hooks as soon as possible.

732
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:29,320
There are a few that are missing, but

733
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,680
we're working on them. And hooks let you

734
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,140
reuse stateful logic, extracted out of

735
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:38,230
components, tested separately, reuse it

736
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:39,850
between different components without

737
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,850
introducing the wrapper hell. And again

738
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:44,560
importantly it's not a breaking change,

739
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,000
completely backwards compatible, strictly

740
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,240
addition ..., uh, additive. And you can find the,

741
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,700
we wrote the documentation for hooks, so

742
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:59,520
you can find it at this url. Um, and

743
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,340
we want to hear from you, the React

744
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,170
community wanna hear what you think

745
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:07,780
about hooks. Um, whether you like them or not.

746
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:10,420
And we realize that it's pretty hard to

747
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,070
give feedback without actually trying

748
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:17,100
them. So we built them, and we released

749
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:22,000
sixty ..., um, sixteen seven alpha. It's not a

750
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,760
major release, it's a minor release. But

751
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,730
in alpha where you can try hooks. And

752
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:30,700
we've been trying them in production at

753
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:33,610
Facebook for about a month. So we don't

754
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:36,910
expect major bugs there. But the APIs

755
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:40,570
themselves may change together with your

756
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:44,320
feedback. And I asked you not to rewrite

757
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,330
anything like not to rewrite their whole

758
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:50,560
apps with hooks. Because first of all it's,

759
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,400
it's a proposal. And second because

760
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,500
personally I, I find that it takes a bit

761
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,240
of a mind shift to start thinking in

762
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,360
hooks, and it might be a bit confusing if

763
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,310
you try to just take a class component

764
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:07,030
and convert it. But I do encourage you to

765
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:08,710
try using hooks in some of the newer

766
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:11,110
code that you write in and let us know

767
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:15,450
what you think. So,

768
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:16,310
thank you.

769
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:20,650
[Applause]

770
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:22,150
[Applause]

771
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:25,880
So in our view hooks represent our

772
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:30,800
vision for the future of React. But I

773
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,640
think they also represent the way we

774
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,540
move React forward. And that is we don't

775
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:43,190
do big rewrite. Uh, we want the new patterns

776
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:46,790
that we like better to coexist with the

777
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:49,820
old patterns, so that we can have gradual

778
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:52,940
migration and adoption just like you can

779
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:57,890
gradually adopt React itself. And this is

780
00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:00,350
almost the end of my talk. Uh, I want to end

781
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:11,690
it on a personal note. So I started

782
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:16,990
learning React about four years ago. And

783
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:20,980
one of my first questions was why JSX.

784
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:25,520
Uh, but my second one of the next questions

785
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,730
was I can figure out what does the logo

786
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:32,180
have to do with React. So the project is

787
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:35,660
not called Atom, it's not a physics

788
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,610
engine.

789
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:40,670
Um, so one interpretation is that it's kind

790
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:41,630
of upon on

791
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:44,330
reactions, so atoms participate in

792
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:48,140
chemical reactions, reactions -> React. Um, but

793
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:50,090
it's not a claim with React actually

794
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:52,400
got it, uh, I found a different interpretation

795
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,770
that made more sense to me. And the way I

796
00:46:57,770 --> 00:46:59,980
think about it, uh,

797
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:02,930
we know that physical matter consists of

798
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:07,010
atoms. And we've learned that it's the

799
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:08,750
types of these atoms and their

800
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:11,600
properties that determine how the

801
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:15,160
physical matter looks and behaves. And

802
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,600
React has taught me something similar, 

803
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,330
that you can take a user interface and

804
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:23,120
you can split it into these independent

805
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:26,480
units called components, and it's the

806
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,000
types and properties of these components

807
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
that can describe how the user interface

808
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,290
looks and behaves.

809
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:38,270
What's ironic though is that the word

810
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:43,580
'atom', it literally means indivisible. So

811
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:45,560
when scientists just discovered atom for

812
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,090
the first time, they thought this is the

813
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:50,690
smallest thing we're gonna find. But

814
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:53,720
later they discovered an electron, which

815
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,840
is a smaller particle inside the atom.

816
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,580
And it turned out it actually electrons

817
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:03,770
explain a lot about how atoms work. And I

818
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:05,980
kind of feel the same way about hooks. I

819
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:10,000
don't feel like hooks are a new feature.

820
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,370
Rather I feel that hooks provide me with

821
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:15,830
access to React features that I already

822
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:18,530
know, such as state and context and lifecycle.

823
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:26,300
And I feel like hooks are a more

824
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:29,290
direct representation of React. And that

825
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:32,780
they really explain how a component

826
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:36,230
works inside. And I feel like they've

827
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:38,750
been hiding in plain sight for four

828
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:41,930
years. And in fact if you look at the

829
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:44,660
React logo, you can see those electron

830
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:47,510
orbits there. So maybe hooks have been

831
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:51,600
there all along. Thank you.

832
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:57,440
[Applause]

833
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:04,620
[Applause]

834
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:07,270
Dan, thank you so much. Sophie thank you

835
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:09,000
as well.
